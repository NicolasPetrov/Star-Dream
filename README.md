My game on Scratch for CS50 Problem Set 0 at Harvard University. The game tells about a girl Emily, who wants to become a musical star. The game mechanics of Guitar Hero game is used. Realised story (cut-scenes + 4 levels) and free play mode (4 different songs are available to choose from). Play online [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1056566722).

The lyrics of the songs are written by me. The neural network ‘Suno’ was used for music generation.  The neural network ‘Midjorney’ was used to create background images. Sprites placed and available for download on the site ‘Freepik’ were used.
